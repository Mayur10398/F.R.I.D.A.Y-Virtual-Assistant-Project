# FRIDAY--Virtual-Assistant-Practice-Project-
A Virtual Assistance program.


# Virtual Assistance Program

Here I have created a beginner-level virtual assistance program named(F.R.I.D.A.Y) developed in Python. The program is designed to assist users with various tasks through voice commands. It utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities to interact with the user.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: The program can recognize voice commands spoken by the user.
- **Task Assistance**: Perform tasks such as searching the web, opening applications, sending emails, etc., based on user commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Responses are provided to the user through text-to-speech conversion.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the program.
4. Start interacting with the virtual assistant using voice commands.

## Dependencies
- Python
- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3
